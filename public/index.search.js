Every commit to the main branch will trigger a GitHub Action, causing the page to rebuild itself. This takes only a minute or two before the changes are updated. This structure provides a beautiful site, solid uptime, and the ability to even make edits in the GitHub web editor.\nEditing existing pages Navigate to the page that you would like edit and select the icon in the top right of the page. See Learning the syntax for more information on making edits.\nCreating new pages \u0026 sections Create a new folder, named whatever you want inside of content/\u003cdesired location\u003e. Create a new file here named _index.md, this file will contain your pageâ€™s content. If sub-pages are desired, add a new file titled \u003cfilename.md\u003e inside of your newest folder. See Relearn Theme Docs for better documentation.\nLearning the syntax The syntax used here can be as simple as Markdown (Discord uses this), however, may get more advanced if you want something fancy.\nThe following two guides are excellent sources for learning Markdown:\nRelearn Theme Docs Markdown Docs This framework also allows the use of HTML code instead of Markdown, however, Shortcodes may be better suited to what you want to do.\nThe following two references may help you learn the Shortcodes that may be used:\nRelearn Shortcodes Hugo Shortcodes Making local edits In order to make local edits on your own machine, we will need to follow a couple of steps:\nInstall Git if you do not already have it Install Hugo (Extended edition) Install Go Clone https://github.com/YCP-Rev-Metrix/Wiki.git in your favorite IDE or terminal Open a Git terminal in the directory of your new repository. For VS users, this can be (Toolbar) Git \u003e Open in command prompt Launch a live server by calling hugo serve (git or wsl terminal) Navigate a browser to http://localhost:1313/Wiki Make changes (mostly in content directory). After saving, you should see the page refresh live. After making your changes, push or merge your changes back up to the main branch. Your changes will now be reflected on the WWW in a few minutes.
