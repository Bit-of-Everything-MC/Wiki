After installing Visual Studio, you will also need to install [SQL Server Developer Edition (Free)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2215158&clcid=0x409&culture=en-us&country=us).  All of the default installation settings can be followed for this.  Finally, you'll need to install [SQL Server Management Studio](https://aka.ms/ssmsfullsetup).  The default installation options for SSMS can be followed here also.
